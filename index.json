Our lab‚Äôs research in Maternal and Child Health, particularly concerning preterm birth, is employing multi-omics and wearable technology to deepen understanding and improve outcomes. Our lab is likely integrating data from these multi-omics analyses with information collected from wearable devices to create a comprehensive picture of maternal and fetal health. This integrated approach can identify patterns and risk factors associated with preterm birth and other pregnancy-related complications. Advanced data analysis techniques, including machine learning and AI, are used to analyze these complex datasets, aiming to develop predictive models for adverse pregnancy outcomes.\nMaternal and Child Health (MCH) is a critical public health domain focused on the health and well-being of mothers and children. Within this field, one significant area of concern is preterm birth, defined as the delivery of a baby before 37 weeks of gestation. Preterm birth is a leading cause of neonatal mortality and can have long-term impacts on health and development. Factors contributing to preterm birth are multifaceted, encompassing genetic, environmental, socioeconomic, and healthcare-related aspects.\nYour lab‚Äôs research in Maternal and Child Health, particularly concerning preterm birth, is employing multi-omics and wearable technology to deepen understanding and improve outcomes. Multi-omics, encompassing genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and microbiomics, offers a comprehensive approach to unraveling the complex biological mechanisms underlying pregnancy, including the risk factors and pathways leading to preterm birth. This approach allows for the identification of biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets.\nFor example, genomics can provide insights into genetic predispositions to preterm birth, while transcriptomics and proteomics can reveal changes in gene expression and protein levels associated with pregnancy complications. Metabolomics offers a snapshot of metabolic changes during pregnancy, and microbiomics sheds light on the role of the microbiome in maternal and fetal health.\nIn tandem, wearable technology is increasingly being utilized in MCH research. Wearables, such as smartwatches and fitness trackers, can continuously monitor vital signs like heart rate, sleep patterns, and physical activity. More advanced wearables can track physiological parameters specific to pregnancy, such as uterine activity or fetal heart rate. This real-time monitoring can help in early detection of abnormalities, leading to timely interventions.\nYour lab is likely integrating data from these multi-omics analyses with information collected from wearable devices to create a comprehensive picture of maternal and fetal health. This integrated approach can identify patterns and risk factors associated with preterm birth and other pregnancy-related complications. Advanced data analysis techniques, including machine learning and AI, are used to analyze these complex datasets, aiming to develop predictive models for adverse pregnancy outcomes.\nUltimately, your lab‚Äôs research in Maternal and Child Health using multi-omics and wearables aims to advance our understanding of the biological, physiological, and environmental factors influencing maternal and fetal health.

Here, we discovered a well-defined interface between the synaptic vesicle V-ATPase and synaptophysin by in situ cryo-electron tomography and single particle cryo-electron microscopy of functional synaptic vesicles isolated from mouse brains3. The synaptic vesicle V-ATPase is an ATP-dependent proton pump that establishes the protein gradient across the synaptic vesicle, which in turn drives the uptake of neurotransmitters4,5. Synaptophysin6 and its paralogs synaptoporin7 and synaptogyrin8 belong to a family of abundant synaptic vesicle proteins whose function is still unclear. We performed structural and functional studies of synaptophysin knockout mice, confirming the identity of synaptophysin as an interaction partner with the V-ATPase. Although there is little change in the conformation of the V-ATPase upon interaction with synaptophysin, the presence of synaptophysin in synaptic vesicles profoundly affects the copy number of V-ATPases. This effect on the topography of synaptic vesicles suggests that synaptophysin assists in their biogenesis. In support of this model, we observed that synaptophysin knockout mice exhibit severe seizure susceptibility, suggesting an imbalance of neurotransmitter release as a physiological consequence of the absence of synaptophysin.","tags":null,"title":"Structure and topography of the synaptic V-ATPase‚Äìsynaptophysin complex","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chuchu WANG"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1717246800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1719839956,"objectID":"6ba5a6b19ebe3abf7c3b895255982bb6","permalink":"https://cleowang-lab.github.io/event/2024-asms/","publishdate":"2024-06-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/event/2024-asms/","section":"event","summary":"Nonlinear Dynamic Changes During Human Aging Revealed in Multi-omics Profiles","tags":[],"title":"Nonlinear Dynamic Changes During Human Aging Revealed in Multi-omics Profiles","type":"event"},{"authors":["Chuchu WANG"],"categories":null,"content":"Our overarching research interests are bioinformatics algorithms development for multi-omics and wearable data, and their application to precision medicine and biological questions.\nüíª Method Development For Multi-Omics and Wearable Data üß¨ Mass Spectrometry Data Mass spectrometry (MS) is an analytical technique used to measure the mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of ions.

traceability, and transparency have been long-standing issues for metabolomics data analysis. Multiple tools have been developed, but limitations still exist. Here, we present the tidyMass project (https://www.tidymass.org/), a comprehensive R-based computational framework that can achieve the traceable, shareable, and reproducible workflow needs of data processing and analysis for LC-MS-based untargeted metabolomics. TidyMass is an ecosystem of R packages that share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structure, which provides a comprehensive, reproducible, and object-oriented computational framework. The modular architecture makes tidyMass a highly flexible and extensible tool, which other users can improve and integrate with other tools to customize their own pipeline.","tags":null,"title":"TidyMass an object-oriented reproducible analysis framework for LC‚ÄìMS data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chuchu
